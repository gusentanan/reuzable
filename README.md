This library has emerged from my own experience in building apps. I found myself repeatedly copying and pasting its components into my projects whenever I needed them. Then, I decided to create a library with the hope that it would make my development process easier.
### Libs feature
- `core-logger`: built in function to make logging more easier.
- `core-media-date`: converting different DateTime pattern.
- `core-ui`: extension function that related to UI.
- coming soon
